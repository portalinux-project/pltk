# The PortaLinux ToolKit
The PortaLinux ToolKit, or PLTK, is a GUI toolkit made to work with the
PortaLinux operating system. It will currently only have a Wayland backend, but
it will also have both XCB and libdrm backends. The PLTK API might also get
ported to other systems that are not Unix-like or even running an operating
system.

Currently, there is no build system, as i have yet to get functional code in
here and i will have to modify whatever current build system i have made anyway
